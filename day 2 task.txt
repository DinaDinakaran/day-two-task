A.difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs.?

1.node js is using on v8 but the browsers is differ with our own engine (ex ; safari is working on webKit)
2.node js only a java script environment but browser js javascript is one of the part ,it's also wroking on retering engine so webpage shown
3.node js os mostly using on backend developers(sever side) and browser is frontend development(clint side) but both are runs at javascript
4.node js is runs in outside over the browser but browser only runs at only a browser engine
5.the node js not comfortable for using HTML links but browser side is enough to adding a HTML Links 

B.summery of video about how is working on browser;
1.the parse our css and our HTML that creating a DOM tree
2.the DOM tree then gets converted in to render tree,so the CSS the HTML combined.
3.it's actually 4 trees 
               A.the layer
               B.the line boxes
               C.the render objects
               D.the render styles
4.so layout is a process where it computes where the elements will appear onthe page
5.the combination on CSS and other element to process and produce the final out images or web pages
C.Execute the below code and write your description in txt file

1.typeof(1)
ans ; number
code; console.log(typeof(1));


2.typeof(1.1)
ans;number
code; console.log(typeof(1.1));



3.typeof('1.1')
ans;string
code; console.log(typeof("1.1"));



4.typeof(true)
ans;boolean
code; console.log(typeof(false));



5.typeof(null)
ans;object
code; console.log(typeof(null));



6.typeof(undefined)
ans;undifined
code; console.log(typeof(undefined));

7.typeof([])
ans;object
code; console.log(typeof(null));



8.typeof({})
ans;object
code; console.log(typeof(null));


9.typeof(NaN)
